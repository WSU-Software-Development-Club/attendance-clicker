# Project Synopsis

**Project Name:** Attendance Clicker

**Brief Description:**  
Attendance Clicker is a real-time polling application that allows instructors to create and manage polls for attendance tracking, and students to submit their responses. The backend is built using the Axum web framework in Rust, while the frontend is developed with React and Node.js. Docker is used for containerizing both the frontend and backend, and PostgreSQL handles the database operations.

**Why this project was chosen:**  
This project was selected to explore modern web development with Rust and Axum for the backend, along with React and Node.js for the frontend. It leverages Docker for containerized development, providing practical experience with building and deploying scalable web applications.

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Key tools being used:**  
- **Axum**: Rust-based web framework for asynchronous backend services.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for handling frontend logic and API communication.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for managing the frontend and backend services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing poll and user data.
- **Rust**: Backend development language for fast, safe web services.

**Extra:**  
- This project provides a comprehensive learning experience with both frontend and backend development, using modern technologies like Axum, React, and Docker.
